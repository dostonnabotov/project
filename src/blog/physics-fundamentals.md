## Particle Kinematics

### Formulas

- Average Velocity

The **velocity** of a particle is the rate at which its position changes with time.

$$ \vec{v} = \frac{\Delta \vec{r}}{\Delta t} = \frac{(r_1-r_0)}{(t_1-t_0)} = \frac{displacement}{time} $$

- Instantaneous velocity

$$ \vec{v} = \lim_{\Delta t \to 0} \frac{\Delta \vec{r}}{\Delta t} $$

- Acceleration 

The **acceleration** of a particle is the rate of change of its velocity with time.

$$ \vec{a} = \frac{\Delta \vec{v}}{\Delta t} = \frac{(v_1-v_0)}{(t_1-t_0)} = \frac{velocity}{time} $$

- Instantaneous acceleration

$$ \vec{a} = \lim_{\Delta t \to 0} \frac{\Delta \vec{v}}{\Delta t} $$

- Definition of acceleration

$$ v_{x} = v_{x0} + a_{x}t $$

- The displacement curve

$$ x = x_{0} + v_{x}t $$

or 

$$ x = x_{0} + v_{x0}t + \frac{1}{2}a_{x}t^2 $$

- Other kinematic equations

$$ v^2 = v_{0}^{2} + 2a(x - x_{0}) $$

$$ x - x_{0} = (\frac{1}{2})(v_{0} + v)t $$

- Dealing with $y$ direction

We simply replace $x$ by $y$ 

$$ v_{y} = v_{y0} + a_{y}t $$ 

$$ y = (\frac{1}{2})(v_{y0} + v_{y})t $$

$$ y = y_{0} + v_{y0}t + \frac{1}{2}a_{y}t^2 $$

$$ v_{y}^{2} = v_{y0}^{2} + 2a(y - y_{0}) $$
