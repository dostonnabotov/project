## Mathematical LOGIC

Task 1: For the given Boolean function $ f(x,y,z) = (x \downarrow \overline{y}) \leftrightarrow (z \rightarrow \overline{x}) $

  1. Draw the function’s truth table
  2. Find the function’s number
  3. Define the function, using numbers of binary vectors
  4. Find its DNF ( Disjunctive Normal Form )
  5. Find its dual function ( using two methods: definition & theorem )
  6. Simplify the function by reducing it into a polynomial of modulo 2
  7. Find its Full DNF and Full CNF
  8. Draw its Carnaugh map
  9. Draw its Unit Cube
  10. Find its minimal DNF
