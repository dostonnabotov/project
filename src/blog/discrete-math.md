## Mathematical LOGIC

For the given Boolean function $ f(x,y,z) = (x \downarrow \overline{y}) \leftrightarrow (z \rightarrow \overline{x}) $

  1. Draw the function’s truth table
  2. Find the function’s number
  3. Define the function, using numbers of binary vectors
  4. Find its DNF ( Disjunctive Normal Form )
  5. Find its dual function ( using two methods: definition & theorem )
  6. Simplify the function by reducing it into a polynomial of modulo 2
  7. Find its Full DNF and Full CNF
  8. Draw its Carnaugh map
  9. Draw its Unit Cube
  10. Find its minimal DNF

## COMPLETE SYSTEMS of Boolean functions

Check the belonging of Boolean functions using the following 5 classes

  1. Class $ C_0 $ = The class of all 0-preserving functions;
  2. Class $ C_1 $ = The class of all 1-preserving functions;
  3. Class $ L $ = The class of all linear functions;
  4. Class $ S $ = The class of all self-dual functions;
  5. Class $ M $ = The class of all monotonic functions


## The principle of Mathematical induction

Mathematical Induction is a mathematical proof technique, which consists of 3 steps:

  - 1st step: the Base of induction. – We check if the statement is true for some initial value $ n = 1 $;
  - 2nd step: the Assumption of induction. – We assume that the statement holds for any value $ n = m $;
  - 3rd step: the Inductive step. – We prove that the statement holds for the next value $ n = m+1 $.

## Operations on SETS

For the arbitrary sets A, B, C, prove or disprove the given composite set equality:

  1. Graphically, using the Venn diagram
  2. Using the basic formulas and simplification of one or both sides of the equality
  3. Using the Comparison method

## Mapping on SETS

Classify the given mapping y A B :  by checking its 6 properties

  1. Well-defined
  2. Functional
  3. Surjective
  4. Injective
  5. Bijective
  6. Inverse

Good luck! :smile:
